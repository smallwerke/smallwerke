Hi, Iâ€™m @smallwerke, I'm using this repository to store code that I find useful. Most (all) of it is currently based in R and are tools that I use for the bioinformatic analysis that I do AND that are in a state for public release... They are broken down into two installable packages.

- Histova is a more *full featured* package that I use to generate basic histograms to represent data from many of the common assays we run in the lab
- BioUtils are a collection of functions that I use and find useful and basically wanted to have a quick way of accessing them so I stuck them into a 'package'...
